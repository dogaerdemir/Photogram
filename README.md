# Photogram
Photo sharing app. Users can create account, login and share photos(supports 'remember me' feature). Photos can be shared both from the gallery and directly from the camera. They can be deleted and shared. Multiple photos of the same user are displayed by grouping via image slide show.App has a simple UI with tab bars.  

It is updated regularly. I'm trying to fix bugs and add new features on a regular basis.
