# Photogram
Photo sharing app. Users can create account, login and share photos(supports 'remember me' feature). Photos can be shared both from the gallery and directly from the camera. They can be deleted and shared. Multiple photos of the same user are displayed by grouping via image slide show.App has a simple UI with tab bars.  

It is updated regularly. Firstly I am going to add new features (user profile picture, user profile page, proper like/dislike feature etc.). Then I will fix layout/design problems via working on autolayout.
